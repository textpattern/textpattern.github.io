# Textpattern themes

Themes have arrived in Textpattern. This page is your waypoint for finding what’s currently available and getting started.

## Themes website

There is a new themes site coming. Few details are available at this point, but presumably it will be a mecca for finding and sharing front-side and admin-side Textpattern themes.

[Follow along with site development](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-themes-website).

* [Textpattern gains Themes support](https://textpattern.com/weblog/403/textpattern-cms-gains-themes-support) (developer overview on theme functionality)
